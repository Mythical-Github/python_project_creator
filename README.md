# python_project_creator
 
wip, python project creator, using uv for virtual env, and pyinstaller for releases\
It's primarily compatibility in mind, is with all windows 10 machines\
This is why mostly sticking to batch only for the many scripts\
end goal is loading most things from json, and allowing for different template repo setups\
it uses https://github.com/jqlang/jq for the json parsing in batch
